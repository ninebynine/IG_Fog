For the beginning, I create an interlaced movement sequence by stacking several images on top of each other with different movemtns and a different cross fade status. \r\n\r\nProgress is slow and I find that with \"Fog\" I have to play the music alongside the edit in order to judge the \"speed\" of the sequence. In \"Smoke\" this had not been necessary. ",
