  "rdfs:comment": "I have now the use of 14 images from Getty Images. When the actual licenses and download links are through I can then work on the image content. The soundtrack is pretty much finished. I only need to edit what there is to fit in with the length of the film. \r\n\r\nAs there are much less images available than for Smoke, I envisage I may have to come back to an earlier idea of using zooms and crops into dense fog sections to increase the length of sections (see Smoke, Log Entries 4 and 5. Although these earlier will have to be modified - Constable's cloud depictions may prove an inspiration. I can see whirls of white and grey morphing into each other. \r\n\r\nAs I have found on previous occasion, limitations may prove to be a (hopefully positive) defining factor and may serve to avoid a mere repetition of Smoke.",
