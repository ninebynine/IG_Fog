  "rdfs:comment": "Today I am starting with the follow-on project from \"Smoke\" (Philadelphia project). The purpose is to gain information about the reuse of creative metadata. To that effect the intern is to later make a blend diagram and relate that to the \"Smoke\" diagram. This should show very immediately whether re-use has sped up the process. I will also endeavour to relate on-hpoing activities to Procedural Blending (PB) terminology.\r\n\r\nThe inputs I am beginning with now relate to photographic images from the Great London Fog of 1952 (see Smoke Log Entry 2), otherwise known as \"pea-souper\" As images rights are being held by a number of newspapers and Getty Images, I envisage that I will not be as easy as with Smoke to gain permission of use free of charge. I have therefore searched for more promising locations, without success. The rights holders for a great deal of the images are *Getty Images* and the *Daily Mail*. I have contacted the latter via email, awaiting reply.\r\n\r\n## visual blend line, a list of further sources: \r\n\r\n[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2243732/Pea-souper-killed-12-000-So-black-screen-cinemas-So-suffocatingly-lethal-ran-coffins-How-Great-Smog-choked-London-60-years-ago-week.html](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2243732/Pea-souper-killed-12-000-So-black-screen-cinemas-So-suffocatingly-lethal-ran-coffins-How-Great-Smog-choked-London-60-years-ago-week.html)\r\n\r\n[http://binscorner.com/pages/g/great-smog-of-london-60-years-ago.html](http://binscorner.com/pages/g/great-smog-of-london-60-years-ago.html)\r\n\r\none new image of parliament [http://daily.jstor.org/old-smoke-londons-famous-fog/](http://daily.jstor.org/old-smoke-londons-famous-fog/)\r\n\r\n[http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2008/08/the_great_london_smog_of_1952](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2008/08/the_great_london_smog_of_1952)\r\n\r\n[http://www.staffs.ac.uk/schools/sciences/environment/GreatFog/fog7.html](http://www.staffs.ac.uk/schools/sciences/environment/GreatFog/fog7.html)\r\n\r\nnew archive with images from Waterloo Bridge: [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/rd/801ed12a-6d5f-4375-988a-5eef5171f7b4](http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/rd/801ed12a-6d5f-4375-988a-5eef5171f7b4) / for contacts see [http://www.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/archive/](http://www.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/archive/) plus further search [http://archive.historicengland.org.uk/results/resultsaj.aspx?t=Quick&cr=London+fog&io=False&l=all](http://archive.historicengland.org.uk/results/resultsaj.aspx?t=Quick&cr=London+fog&io=False&l=all) // [click here for price list](http://archive.historicengland.org.uk/PriceList/Default.aspx)\r\n\r\nlink to modern day pollution info from the *Guardian* in [China](http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/oct/21/china-pollution) and [London](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/poll/2014/mar/16/london-impose-driving-ban) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## audio blend line\r\nThe song I am anticipating to reference in the soundtrack is \"A foggy Day\".\r\n\r\n\r\n## possible slide details:\r\n>Legislation that followed the great smog of 1952 included the City of London (Various Powers) Act of 1954 and the Clean Air Acts of 1956 and 1968.
