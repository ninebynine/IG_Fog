In photoshiop I had created some close-ups that I am now using in Premiere to link between images. \r\n\r\nAs I have far fewer images at my disposal than with \"Smoke\", I am tempted to create more movement through image transitions so that images can be shown for a longer duration. I had used this technique in \"Smoke\", although far more sparingly and for the moment the sequence looks far too hectic.",
